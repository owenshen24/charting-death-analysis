    "On the data science and machine learning platform Kaggle, the competition with the currently highest prize is for a passenger screening algorithm, awarded by the US Department of Homeland Security. Judging from the attention that the threat of terrorism is receiving in the media, these efforts meet a considerable public interest in the danger arising from terrorism. At the same time, the amount of attention that media allocates on multiple other causes of death that are more relevant by orders of magnitude seems to fall behind disproportionately. According to [businessinsider.com](http://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1), the lifetime odds of dying from foreign-born terrorism in the US are 1 in 45808. For comparison, it is approximately five times as likely to die in an airplane or spaceship incident, five and a half times as likely to die from police, almost five hundred times as likely to die from suicide, and respectively about 6500 times as likely to die from a heart disease or cancer, the two most common death causes in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combs and Slovic (1979) compared the frequency distribution of all death causes reported by two US newspapers during a time span of six months in 1975 with the actual mortality rates of that year and people's reported estimates of death cause frequencies. They found that \"The frequency with which the two newspapers [...] reported various causes of death differed considerably from the statistical frequencies of those causes in the U.S. population. The finding that both newspapers, locate on opposite coasts of the U.S., allocated their coverage to causes of death in very similar ways suggests that the particular reporting biases observbed here may be widespread. Violent, often catastrophic causes of death such as homicides, natural disasters and accidents were overreported. Diseases were underreported. These biases in coverage corresponded closely to biases found in a previous study in which people were asked to judge the frequency of the same causes of death.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above two points, we think it's worthwhile to take a data-driven approach to see how causes of death stack up with people's expectations from the media. Attention is zero-sum in today's news environment. Thus, we think it's worthwhile to see if exposure is well-calibrated to the actual scale of the deaths involved.\n",

    "Both CDC and WHO mortality data are raw data that require statistical condensing. Both will be summarized in terms of frequencies, which is why no missing data is to be expected. Webhose and both NYT and Reddit APIs offer access to article / thread titles and in the case of Reddit to full text postings, which must be crawled and summarized according to word frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use regular time intervals (e.g. number of articles about \"cancer\" in the past 3 months vs number of articles about \"smoking\" in the past 3 months) to standardize our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)\n",
    "We will compare the mortality rates per year with the number of occurences in NYT article headlines and Reddit postings. The number of occurences will be measured by the frequency with which words related to death causes occur in article headlines and Reddit post titles. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a selection of death causes, we will break down mortality rates and media coverage into smaller time bins (e.g., months) and compare the development over time. This may be especially insightful in the case of rare death cases that tend to attract a large amount of public attention. Using visualization (and maybe time-series analysis methods), we will try to find out whether reactions to disasters such as disease outbreaks or terrorist attacks differ between print newspapers and online media.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Do you have permission to use this data, for this purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to their Terms of Use, all listed datasets and APIs allow access and use for research purposes, usually within a \"reasonable request volume\". Thus, as long as we don't make too many requests, our sources are all open to the public for our purposes of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are there privacy concerns regarding your datasets that you need to deal with, and/or terms of use that you need to comply with?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our news headline data will only be aggregate data, and we will likely not do much with the actual content, but rather the counts. Thus, there should be no issues there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDC mortality information we'll be using may have outliers which could allow us to potentially identify the deceased (although this is very unlikely). However, we will once again just be looking at the aggregate numbers (i.e. the number of people who died per category) which should mitigate most of this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, Webhose is a freemium service which only allows us to make up to 1,000 requests using their API, so we are rate-limited there.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis? (For example, does your data exclude particular populations, or is it likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mortality datasets are based on official nation- and worldwide numbers, which should reduce underreporting / significant biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for our headlines, the media's attention may be subject to various biases, but they are the very subject of our analysis. However, the news places we're grabbing headlines from (Reddit, The Guardian, and the NYT) are all generally left-leaning publications, which means our data may not be representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our conclusions might not generalize to publications in general, and we'd be unable to differentiate between the hypothesis that \"left-leaning publications do not cover deaths in proportion to the number of casualities\" and \"publications in general do not cover deaths in proportion to the number of casualties\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Discuss your project, looking forward to what your results might mean, how they fit it in with what is already known, and what problems you may encounter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular:\n",
    "#### If your analyses and hypotheses are correct, what will be the contribution of this project to the topic domain?\n",
    "If our analysis and hypotheses are correct, we will have an overall analysis that provides evidence which supports the idea that media attention does not track actual casualties. This supports the discussion about sensationalism and how accurate reporting is important. This is especially relevant in the current political climate where multiple sides accuse the other of misrepresenting the state of affairs (in this case, risks of dying from different things). For a specific example, we could provide information which shows that terrorism is significantly overblown, if we look at its coverage to casualty ratio compared to smoking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternatively, what will you do if you methods don't work and/or your hypotheses are wrong?\n",
    "We'd go back and look at places where things went wrong, identifying where in our analysis the parts which disconfirmed our hypothesis originated from. As this would be surprising, we might have identified a place where not enough attention is being placed; we might have been focusing on the wrong problem. (For example, perhaps the number of articles written actually corresponds with the number of deaths, but the most popular articles still tend to be the ones associated with violent, shocking deaths. This would invalidate our original claim about a bias in media reporting and might instead point to how readers respond to news articles, i.e. reflect a problem with how humans react, rather than an inherent problem with the media).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the potential pitfalls and potential confounds of your data and/or methods that may cause problems, and/or influence your interpretations?\n",
    "As we've already mentioned above, there's potential problems with generalizing our hypothesis, even if the data comes out supporting it, because we're only looking at left-leaning newspapers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the terms used by the WHO and CDC to talk about deaths are quite technical. If we just did a direct search for headlines which used terms like \"cerebrovascular diseases\", we'd likely get very few results. Thus, we'll need to use some subjective judgment for translating those terms into more layman's terms, ones which we'd expect to show up in headlines. This could cause problems, especially if our categorization isn't very smooth (e.g. should all of \"cancer\" be in one category? what if it overlaps with smoking?)\n",
    "\n",
    "This could affect our initial data collection, which in turn could color the rest of our analysis."
